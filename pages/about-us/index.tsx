                        <p>At Half Caf Blog, when we review anything, we don&apos;t simply focus on the overall trendiness of a product/coffee shop but we also put a lot of <strong>emphasis on the actual coffee!</strong> For instance, when we review a coffee shop, <strong>we always order two drinks</strong>, a black <strong>espresso</strong> in order to get a taste for the raw coffee being served and then a <strong>milk drink</strong> to get a taste of whether or not the milk is being heated skillfully.</p>
